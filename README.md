# Simple Rate Limiting API

The goal of this little project was to come up with a way for web services to leverage rate limiting as an external service.
The implementation is inspired by the many researches done to find a good starting point for more production-like implementation.

* Rolling window ([with redis][1]) has been chosen (knowing drawbacks, especially size of lists for dayly/monthy limits for example)
* Redis ([lists][1] and [model][2]) has been chosen to help with the distributed need, and scalability.
* Kong ([Rate Limiting Plugin][3], [Enterprise version][4]) provided a LUA implementation of this, in an API Gateway setting (so different from here)
